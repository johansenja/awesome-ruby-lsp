# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please try to adhere to the simple guidelines below:

## Sections

Please add your addon to the table relevant section, or propose a new section if it doesn't fit existing ones.

Format should be

```
| Name | For | First released | Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- | ------ |
| [Name](https://example.com/link/to/repo) | [name_of_gem_that_addon_is_for](https://example.com/other/link/to/repo) | 2025-02-01 | Hover, go-to-definition |
```

## Ordering

While the number of addons is fairly small, ordering doesn't matter too much :) but I have tried to include addons for more popular gems first
